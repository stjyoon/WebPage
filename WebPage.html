      <h2>Certifications
      </h2>
      <h3>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
      </h3>
      <h3>AWS Solutions Architect Associate
      </h3>
      <p>I studied for the SAA for 2-3 months. Studying for this will also prepare you for the Cloud Practitioner cert in case you want to obtain that as well. I chose to take the Cloud Practioner exam before the Solutions Architect exam for a small confidence boost. I almost exclusively used youtube to study for these certs, a playlist of which is linked below. I hope this helps anyone planning on obtaining these certs.
